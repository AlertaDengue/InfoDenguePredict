This is the documentation of **InfoDenguePredict**.

This Project aims to collect models for time series prediction tested and optimized for the **InfoDengue** system series.
**InfoDengue** is a system that produces continuous epidemic analytics including Nowcasting and Forecasting.
This package is still in alpha, but it aims to provide a stable API for the generation of forecasts based on the available models
as well as tools for model comparison and selection. If you want to contribute to this package, please take a look at the
Contributing section.

.. note::

    This is the main page of your project's `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
    documentation. It is formatted in `reStructuredText
    <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`__. Add additional pages by creating
    rst-files in ``docs`` and adding them to the `toctree
    <http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/toctree.html>`_ below. Use then
    `references <http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html>`__ in order to link
    them from this page, e.g. :ref:`authors <authors>` and :ref:`changes`.
    It is also possible to refer to the documentation of other Python packages
    with the `Python domain syntax
    <http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html#the-python-domain>`__. By default you
    can reference the documentation of `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`__,
    `Python <http://docs.python.org/>`__, `matplotlib
    <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net>`__, `NumPy
    <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy>`__, `Scikit-Learn
    <http://scikit-learn.org/stable>`__, `Pandas
    <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable>`__, `SciPy
    <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`__. You can add more by
    extending the ``intersphinx_mapping`` in your Sphinx's ``conf.py``.
